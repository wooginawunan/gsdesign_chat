\title{Conditional Power at Interim Boundaries}
\usage{
gsBoundCP(x, theta = "thetahat", r = 18)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of type \code{gsDesign} or \code{gsProbability}}

\item{theta}{if \code{"thetahat"} and \code{class(x)!="gsDesign"},
conditional power computations for each boundary value are computed using
estimated treatment effect assuming a test statistic at that boundary
(\code{zi/sqrt(x$n.I[i])} at analysis \code{i}, interim test statistic
\code{zi} and interim sample size/statistical information of
\code{x$n.I[i]}). Otherwise, conditional power is computed assuming the
input scalar value \code{theta}.}

\item{r}{Integer value controlling grid for numerical integration as in
Jennison and Turnbull (2000); default is 18, range is 1 to 80.  Larger
values provide larger number of grid points and greater accuracy.  Normally
\code{r} will not be changed by the user.}
}
\value{
A list containing two vectors, \code{CPlo} and \code{CPhi}.
\item{CPlo}{A vector of length \code{x$k-1} with conditional powers of
crossing upper bounds given interim test statistics at each lower bound}
\item{CPhi}{A vector of length \code{x$k-1} with conditional powers of
crossing upper bounds given interim test statistics at each upper bound.}
}
\description{
\code{gsBoundCP()} computes the total probability of crossing future upper
bounds given an interim test statistic at an interim bound. For each interim
boundary, assumes an interim test statistic at the boundary and computes the
probability of crossing any of the later upper boundaries.

See Conditional power section of manual for further clarification. See also
Muller and Schaffer (2001) for background theory.
