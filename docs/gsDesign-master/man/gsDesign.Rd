\arguments{
\item{k}{Number of analyses planned, including interim and final.}

\item{test.type}{\code{1=}one-sided \cr \code{2=}two-sided symmetric \cr
\code{3=}two-sided, asymmetric, beta-spending with binding lower bound \cr
\code{4=}two-sided, asymmetric, beta-spending with non-binding lower bound
\cr \code{5=}two-sided, asymmetric, lower bound spending under the null
hypothesis with binding lower bound \cr \code{6=}two-sided, asymmetric,
lower bound spending under the null hypothesis with non-binding lower bound.
\cr See details, examples and manual.}

\item{alpha}{Type I error, always one-sided. Default value is 0.025.}

\item{beta}{Type II error, default value is 0.1 (90\% power).}

\item{astar}{Normally not specified. If \code{test.type=5} or \code{6},
\code{astar} specifies the total probability of crossing a lower bound at
all analyses combined.  This will be changed to \eqn{1 - }\code{alpha} when
default value of 0 is used.  Since this is the expected usage, normally
\code{astar} is not specified by the user.}

\item{delta}{Effect size for theta under alternative hypothesis. This can be
set to the standardized effect size to generate a sample size if
\code{n.fix=NULL}. See details and examples.}

\item{n.fix}{Sample size for fixed design with no interim; used to find
maximum group sequential sample size. For a time-to-event outcome, input
number of events required for a fixed design rather than sample size and
enter fixed design sample size (optional) in \code{nFixSurv}.  See details
and examples.}

\item{timing}{Sets relative timing of interim analyses. Default of 1
produces equally spaced analyses.  Otherwise, this is a vector of length
\code{k} or \code{k-1}.  The values should satisfy \code{0 < timing[1] <
timing[2] < ... < timing[k-1] < timing[k]=1}.}

\item{sfu}{A spending function or a character string indicating a boundary
type (that is, \dQuote{WT} for Wang-Tsiatis bounds, \dQuote{OF} for
O'Brien-Fleming bounds and \dQuote{Pocock} for Pocock bounds).  For
one-sided and symmetric two-sided testing is used to completely specify
spending (\code{test.type=1, 2}), \code{sfu}.  The default value is
\code{sfHSD} which is a Hwang-Shih-DeCani spending function.  See details,
\code{vignette("SpendingFunctionOverview")}, manual and examples.}

\item{sfupar}{Real value, default is \eqn{-4} which is an
O'Brien-Fleming-like conservative bound when used with the default
Hwang-Shih-DeCani spending function. This is a real-vector for many spending
functions.  The parameter \code{sfupar} specifies any parameters needed for
the spending function specified by \code{sfu}; this will be ignored for
spending functions (\code{sfLDOF}, \code{sfLDPocock}) or bound types
(\dQuote{OF}, \dQuote{Pocock}) that do not require parameters.}

\item{sfl}{Specifies the spending function for lower boundary crossing
probabilities when asymmetric, two-sided testing is performed
(\code{test.type = 3}, \code{4}, \code{5}, or \code{6}).  Unlike the upper
bound, only spending functions are used to specify the lower bound.  The
default value is \code{sfHSD} which is a Hwang-Shih-DeCani spending
function.  The parameter \code{sfl} is ignored for one-sided testing
(\code{test.type=1}) or symmetric 2-sided testing (\code{test.type=2}).  See
details, spending functions, manual and examples.}

\item{sflpar}{Real value, default is \eqn{-2}, which, with the default
Hwang-Shih-DeCani spending function, specifies a less conservative spending
rate than the default for the upper bound.}

\item{tol}{Tolerance for error (default is 0.000001). Normally this will not
be changed by the user.  This does not translate directly to number of
digits of accuracy, so use extra decimal places.}

\item{r}{Integer value controlling grid for numerical integration as in
Jennison and Turnbull (2000); default is 18, range is 1 to 80.  Larger
values provide larger number of grid points and greater accuracy.  Normally
\code{r} will not be changed by the user.}

\item{n.I}{Used for re-setting bounds when timing of analyses changes from
initial design; see examples.}

\item{maxn.IPlan}{Used for re-setting bounds when timing of analyses changes
from initial design; see examples.}

\item{nFixSurv}{If a time-to-event variable is used, \code{nFixSurv}
computed as the sample size from \code{nSurvival} may be entered to have
\code{gsDesign} compute the total sample size required as well as the number
of events at each analysis that will be returned in \code{n.fix}; this is
rounded up to an even number.}

\item{endpoint}{An optional character string that should represent the type
of endpoint used for the study. This may be used by output functions. Types
most likely to be recognized initially are "TTE" for time-to-event outcomes
with fixed design sample size generated by \code{nSurvival()} and "Binomial"
for 2-sample binomial outcomes with fixed design sample size generated by
\code{nBinomial()}.}

\item{delta1}{\code{delta1} and \code{delta0} may be used to store
information about the natural parameter scale compared to \code{delta} that
is a standardized effect size. \code{delta1} is the alternative hypothesis
parameter value on the natural parameter scale (e.g., the difference in two
binomial rates).}

\item{delta0}{\code{delta0} is the null hypothesis parameter value on the
natural parameter scale.}

\item{overrun}{Scalar or vector of length \code{k-1} with patients enrolled
that are not included in each interim analysis.}

\item{usTime}{Default is NULL in which case upper bound spending time is 
determined by \code{timing}. Otherwise, this should be a vector of length 
\code{k} with the spending time at each analysis (see Details).}

\item{lsTime}{Default is NULL in which case lower bound spending time is 
determined by \code{timing}. Otherwise, this should be a vector of length 
\code{k} with the spending time at each analysis (see Details).}

\item{x}{An \R object of class found among \code{methods(xtable)}.  See
    below on how to write additional method functions for \code{xtable}.}

\item{caption}{Character vector of length 1 or 2 containing the
    table's caption or title.  If length is 2, the second item is the
    "short caption" used when LaTeX generates a "List of Tables". Set to
    \code{NULL} to suppress the caption.  Default value is \code{NULL}. }

\item{label}{Character vector of length 1 containing the LaTeX label
    or HTML anchor. Set to \code{NULL} to suppress the label.  Default
    value is \code{NULL}. }

\item{align}{Character vector of length equal to the number of columns
    of the resulting table, indicating the alignment of the corresponding
    columns.  Also, \code{"|"} may be used to produce vertical lines
    between columns in LaTeX tables, but these are effectively ignored
    when considering the required length of the supplied vector.  If a
    character vector of length one is supplied, it is split as
    \code{strsplit(align, "")[[1]]} before processing. Since the row
    names are printed in the first column, the length of \code{align} is
    one greater than \code{ncol(x)} if \code{x} is a
    \code{data.frame}. Use \code{"l"}, \code{"r"}, and \code{"c"} to
    denote left, right, and center alignment, respectively.  Use
    \code{"p{3cm}"} etc. for a LaTeX column of the specified width. For
    HTML output the \code{"p"} alignment is interpreted as \code{"l"},
    ignoring the width request. Default depends on the class of
    \code{x}. }

\item{digits}{
    Numeric vector of length equal to one (in which case it will be
    replicated as necessary) or to the number of columns of the
    resulting table \bold{or} matrix of the same size as the resulting
    table, indicating the number of digits to display in the
    corresponding columns. Since the row names are printed in the first
    column, the length of the vector \code{digits} or the number of
    columns of the matrix \code{digits} is one greater than
    \code{ncol(x)} if \code{x} is a \code{data.frame}. Default depends
    on the class of \code{x}. If values of \code{digits} are negative, the
    corresponding values of \code{x} are displayed in scientific format
    with \code{abs(digits)} digits.}

\item{display}{
    Character vector of length equal to the number of columns of the
    resulting table, indicating the format for the corresponding columns.
    Since the row names are printed in the first column, the length of
    \code{display} is one greater than \code{ncol(x)} if \code{x} is a
    \code{data.frame}.  These values are passed to the \code{formatC}
    function.  Use \code{"d"} (for integers), \code{"f"}, \code{"e"},
    \code{"E"}, \code{"g"}, \code{"G"}, \code{"fg"} (for reals), or
    \code{"s"} (for strings).  \code{"f"} gives numbers in the usual
    \code{xxx.xxx} format; \code{"e"} and \code{"E"} give
    \code{n.ddde+nn} or \code{n.dddE+nn} (scientific format); \code{"g"}
    and \code{"G"} put \code{x[i]} into scientific format only if it
    saves space to do so.  \code{"fg"} uses fixed format as \code{"f"},
    but \code{digits} as number of \emph{significant} digits.  Note that
    this can lead to quite long result strings.  Default depends on the
    class of \code{x}.}

\code{beta} for the output value of \code{delta}.  If \code{delta=0} was
input, then this is the sample size required for the specified group
sequential design when a fixed design requires a sample size of

\code{nSurv}. Note that if you use \code{gsSurv} for time-to-event sample

\code{test.type=4} or \code{6}, this contains false positive probabilities
under the null hypothesis assuming that crossing a futility bound does not
stop the trial.} \item{en}{Expected sample size accounting for early

includes the overrun at each interim.}

\description{
\code{gsDesign()} is used to find boundaries and trial size required for a
group sequential design.

Many parameters normally take on default values and thus do not require
explicit specification. One- and two-sided designs are supported. Two-sided
designs may be symmetric or asymmetric. Wang-Tsiatis designs, including
O'Brien-Fleming and Pocock designs can be generated. Designs with common
spending functions as well as other built-in and user-specified functions
for Type I error and futility are supported. Type I error computations for
asymmetric designs may assume binding or non-binding lower bounds. The print
function has been extended using \code{\link{print.gsDesign}()} to print
\code{gsDesign} objects; see examples.

The user may ignore the structure of the value returned by \code{gsDesign()}
if the standard printing and plotting suffice; see examples.

\code{delta} and \code{n.fix} are used together to determine what sample
size output options the user seeks. The default, \code{delta=0} and
\code{n.fix=1}, results in a \sQuote{generic} design that may be used with
any sampling situation. Sample size ratios are provided and the user
multiplies these times the sample size for a fixed design to obtain the
corresponding group sequential analysis times. If \code{delta>0},
\code{n.fix} is ignored, and \code{delta} is taken as the standardized
effect size - the signal to noise ratio for a single observation; for
example, the mean divided by the standard deviation for a one-sample normal
problem.  In this case, the sample size at each analysis is computed.  When
\code{delta=0} and \code{n.fix>1}, \code{n.fix} is assumed to be the sample
size for a fixed design with no interim analyses. See examples below.

Following are further comments on the input argument \code{test.type} which
is used to control what type of error measurements are used in trial design.
The manual may also be worth some review in order to see actual formulas for
boundary crossing probabilities for the various options.  Options 3 and 5
assume the trial stops if the lower bound is crossed for Type I and Type II
error computation (binding lower bound).  For the purpose of computing Type
I error, options 4 and 6 assume the trial continues if the lower bound is
crossed (non-binding lower bound); that is a Type I error can be made by
crossing an upper bound after crossing a previous lower bound.
Beta-spending refers to error spending for the lower bound crossing
probabilities under the alternative hypothesis (options 3 and 4). In this
case, the final analysis lower and upper boundaries are assumed to be the
same. The appropriate total beta spending (power) is determined by adjusting
the maximum sample size through an iterative process for all options. Since
options 3 and 4 must compute boundary crossing probabilities under both the
null and alternative hypotheses, deriving these designs can take longer than
other options. Options 5 and 6 compute lower bound spending under the null
hypothesis.
