\arguments{
\item{z1}{Scalar or vector with interim standardized Z-value(s). Input of
multiple values makes it easy to plot the revised sample size as a function
of the interim test statistic.}

\item{n2}{stage 2 sample size to be used in computing sufficient statistic
when combining stage 1 and 2 test statistics.}

\item{z2}{a combination function that returns a test statistic cutoff for
the stage 2 test based in the interim test statistic supplied in \code{z1},
the design \code{x} and the stage 2 sample size.}

\item{theta}{If \code{NULL} (default), conditional power calculation will be
based on estimated interim treatment effect. Otherwise, \code{theta} is the
standardized effect size used for conditional power calculation. Using the
alternate hypothesis treatment effect can be more efficient than the
estimated effect size; see Liu and Chi, Biometrics (2001).}

\item{x}{A group sequential design with 2 stages (\code{k=2}) generated by
\code{\link{gsDesign}}. For \code{plot.ssrCP}, \code{x} is a design returned
by \code{ssrCP()}.}

\item{...}{Allows passing of arguments that may be needed by the
user-supplied function, codez2. In the case of \code{plot.ssrCP()}, allows
passing more graphical parameters.}

\item{maxinc}{Maximum fold-increase from planned maximum sample size in
underlying group sequential design provided in \code{x}.}

\item{overrun}{The number of patients enrolled before the interim analysis
is completed who are not included in the interim analysis.}

\item{beta}{Targeted Type II error (1 - targeted conditional power); used
for conditional power in sample size reestimation.}

\item{cpadj}{Range of values strictly between 0 and 1 specifying the range
of interim conditional power for which sample size re-estimation is to be
performed. Outside of this range, the sample size supplied in \code{x} is
used.}

\item{z1ticks}{Test statistic values at which tick marks are to be made on
x-axis; automatically calculated under default of \code{NULL}}

\item{mar}{Plot margins; see help for \code{par}}

\item{ylab}{y-axis label}

\item{xlaboffset}{offset on x-axis for printing x-axis labels}

\item{lty}{line type for stage 2 sample size}

\item{col}{line color for stage 2 sample size}

\item{delta}{Natural parameter values for power calculation; see
\code{\link{gsDesign}} for a description of how this is related to
\code{theta}.}

\item{r}{Integer value controlling grid for numerical integration as in
Jennison and Turnbull (2000); default is 18, range is 1 to 80.  Larger
values provide larger number of grid points and greater accuracy.  Normally
\code{r} will not be changed by the user.}
}
\value{
\code{ssrCP} returns a list with the following items: \item{x}{As
input.} \item{z2fn}{As input in \code{z2}.} \item{theta}{standardize effect
size used for conditional power; if \code{NULL} is input, this is computed
as \code{z1/sqrt(n1)} where \code{n1} is the stage 1 sample size.}
\item{maxinc}{As input.} \item{overrun}{As input.} \item{beta}{As input.}
\item{cpadj}{As input.} \item{dat}{A data frame containing the input
\code{z1} values, computed cutoffs for the standard normal test statistic
based solely on stage 2 data (\code{z2}), stage 2 sample sizes (\code{n2}),
stage 2 conditional power (\code{CP}), standardize effect size used for
conditional power calculation (\code{theta}), and the natural parameter
value corresponding to \code{theta} (\code{delta}). The relation between
\code{theta} and \code{delta} is determined by the \code{delta0} and
\code{delta1} values from \code{x}: \code{delta = delta0 +
theta(delta1-delta0)}.}

\description{
\code{ssrCP()} adapts 2-stage group sequential designs to 2-stage sample
size re-estimation designs based on interim analysis conditional power. This
is a simple case of designs developed by Lehmacher and Wassmer, Biometrics
(1999). The conditional power designs of Bauer and Kohne (1994), 
Proschan and Hunsberger (1995), Cui, Hung and Wang (1999) and Liu and Chi (2001), 
Gao, Ware and Mehta (2008), and Mehta and Pocock (2011). Either the estimated
treatment effect at the interim analysis or any chosen effect size can be
used for sample size re-estimation. If not done carefully, these designs can
be very inefficient. It is probably a good idea to compare any design to a
simpler group sequential design; see, for example, Jennison and Turnbull
(2003). The a assumes a small Type I error is included with the interim
analysis and that the design is an adaptation from a 2-stage group
sequential design Related functions include 3 pre-defined combination test
functions (\code{z2NC}, \code{z2Z}, \code{z2Fisher}) that represent the
inverse normal combination test (Lehmacher and Wassmer, 1999), the
sufficient statistic for the complete data, and Fisher's combination test.
\code{Power.ssrCP} computes unconditional power for a conditional power
design derived by \code{ssrCP}.

\code{condPower} is a supportive routine that also is interesting in its own
right; it computes conditional power of a combination test given an interim
test statistic, stage 2 sample size and combination test statistic. While
the returned data frame should make general plotting easy, the function
\code{plot.ssrCP()} prints a plot of study sample size by stage 1 outcome
with multiple x-axis labels for stage 1 z-value, conditional power, and
stage 1 effect size relative to the effect size for which the underlying
group sequential design was powered.

Sample size re-estimation using conditional power and an interim estimate of
treatment effect was proposed by several authors in the 1990's (see
references below). Statistical testing for these original methods was based
on combination tests since Type I error could be inflated by using a
sufficient statistic for testing at the end of the trial. Since 2000, more
efficient variations of these conditional power designs have been developed.
Fully optimized designs have also been derived (Posch et all, 2003,
Lokhnygina and Tsiatis, 2008). Some of the later conditional power methods
allow use of sufficient statistics for testing (Chen, DeMets and Lan, 2004,
Gao, Ware and Mehta, 2008, and Mehta and Pocock, 2011).

The methods considered here are extensions of 2-stage group sequential
designs that include both an efficacy and a futility bound at the planned
interim analysis. A maximum fold-increase in sample size (\code{maxinc})from
the supplied group sequential design (\code{x}) is specified by the user, as
well as a range of conditional power (\code{cpadj}) where sample size should
be re-estimated at the interim analysis, 1-the targeted conditional power to
be used for sample size re-estimation (\code{beta}) and a combination test
statistic (\code{z2}) to be used for testing at the end of the trial. The
input value \code{overrun} represents incremental enrollment not included in
the interim analysis that is not included in the analysis; this is used for
calculating the required number of patients enrolled to complete the trial.

Whereas most of the methods proposed have been based on using the interim
estimated treatment effect size (default for \code{ssrCP}), the variable
\code{theta} allows the user to specify an alternative; Liu and Chi (2001)
suggest that using the parameter value for which the trial was originally
powered is a good choice.
