# Test: checking for Censoring Rates

    Fixed design, two-arm trial with time-to-event
    outcome (Lachin and Foulkes, 1986).
    Solving for:  Accrual duration 
    Hazard ratio                  H1/H0=0.6/1

    Min. end-of-study follow-up: minfup=0.2
    Expected events (total, H1):        160.6536

    Control event rates (H1):

    Censoring rates:

    Power:                 100*(1-beta)=90%
    Type I error (1-sided):   100*alpha=2.5%
    Equal randomization:          ratio=1
